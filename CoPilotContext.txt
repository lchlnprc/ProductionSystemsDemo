PROJECT NAME: Production Systems Demo

PROJECT PURPOSE:
This project simulates a real-world production line hardware testing system similar to those used in IoT manufacturing environments (e.g. Halter, Tesla, Apple, etc). 
The goal is to design a professional-grade automated test platform that validates hardware devices, captures test results, stores historical data, and provides real-time dashboards.

SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
The platform consists of:
1. Arduino hardware streaming sensor data.
2. A Python automated testing framework that communicates with the Arduino, runs test suites, validates results, and posts structured results to backend APIs.
3. A Java Spring Boot backend API that stores test runs, manages devices, and provides reporting endpoints.
4. A React + TypeScript frontend dashboard that visualizes production test data and system health.

HARDWARE:
- Arduino Nano (ATmega328P, CH340 USB-serial)
- DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- Serial communication over USB

PYTHON TEST RUNNER:
- Python 3.13
- pyserial for device communication
- pytest for automated test execution
- Rich CLI output for production operators
- Structured JSON test results
- REST API client to transmit results to backend
- Dockerised execution environment
- USB device passthrough to container

Responsibilities:
- Detect Arduino devices
- Read sensor data
- Run test sequences:
  - Sensor connectivity test
  - Range validation test
  - Stability test (time series)
  - Noise & fluctuation analysis
- Produce structured JSON test results
- Post results to backend APIs
- Generate CLI output suitable for production line operators

JAVA BACKEND API:
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL database
- Flyway migrations
- Lombok
- Testcontainers
- Dockerised runtime

Responsibilities:
- Accept test run submissions
- Store test results
- Track device history
- Provide reporting APIs
- Aggregate metrics
- Provide dashboard endpoints

Core Entities:
- Device
- TestRun
- SensorReading
- TestResult

FRONTEND DASHBOARD:
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- Recharts
- TanStack Query
- Dockerised build + runtime

Features:
- Live production test dashboard
- Test run history
- Pass/fail analytics
- Sensor graphs
- Device tracking
- Operator-friendly UI

SYSTEM DESIGN GOALS:
- Production-grade architecture
- Clean layering
- Strong typing
- Testability
- Scalability
- Clean code practices
- Real-world engineering patterns
- Docker
- Docker Compose orchestration
- Multi-container architecture
- Environment-variable driven configuration
- Production-like deployment topology

CODING STYLE:
- Clean architecture
- SOLID principles
- Domain-driven design
- Strong typing
- Readable naming
- Proper error handling
- Structured logging
- Professional commit practices

Target outcome:
A fully containerised end-to-end production test platform capable of automatically validating hardware devices, storing structured test results, and displaying rich operational dashboards.
